#Zookeeper

‚Üê Projects of the track Python for Beginners

#### Learning outcomes
This project is aimed at our beginners. It helps you understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and while loops.

#### About
This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

* Stage 1/4 - Rush into print
First, let's try to get some simple output from your code.
* Stage 2/4 - Show me an animal!
Show the zookeeper an image of her ward.
* Stage 3/4 - What's inside?
The zookeeper wants to know what is inside each habitat, by its number.
* Stage 4/4 - Sustainable care <3
Finally, your program is able to work for as long as needed!

# Stage 1/4: Rush into print.
#### Description
There are many animals in the zoo, and all of them need care. The animals must be fed, cleaned, surrounded by their kin, and kept happy. That is a difficult task for our large zoo, so one of your employers has suggested a more convenient way to keep track of everything. She wants to be able to pull up a video feed of any animal in the zoo with the help of a program. Being able to check on each habitat would help the zookeepers take care of our furry friends more efficiently!

In this project, you will create a program that helps the zookeepers check on the animals and make sure that they're doing well. Your product will be able to process commands from the zookeepers and display the animals on a monitor.

#### Objectives
To begin with, you will develop a simple printer. Your program should display the text from the output example.

#### Example:
The output
```
I love animals!
Let's check on the animals...
The deer looks fine.
The bat looks happy.
The lion looks healthy.
```
# Stage 2/4: Show me an animal!
#### Description
One of the most important parts of working with animals is keeping an eye on them. We need to see the animals on the screen to know how they are doing, right? Now we are ready to print something awesome: an image of an animal!

#### Objectives
For the second stage, you will need to develop an animal printer. Your program should display the animal identified in the code field.

#### Example:
Your output should contain the following ASCII image:
```
Switching on the camera in the camel habitat...
 ___.-''''-.
/___  @    |
',,,,.     |         _.'''''''._
     '     |        /           \
     |     \    _.-'             \
     |      '.-'                  '-.
     |                               ',
     |                                '',
      ',,-,                           ':;
           ',,| ;,,                 ,' ;;
              ! ; !'',,,',',,,,'!  ;   ;:
             : ;  ! !       ! ! ;  ;   :;
             ; ;   ! !      ! !  ; ;   ;,
            ; ;    ! !     ! !   ; ;
            ; ;    ! !    ! !     ; ;
           ;,,      !,!   !,!     ;,;
           /_I      L_I   L_I     /_I
Look at that! Our little camel is sunbathing!
